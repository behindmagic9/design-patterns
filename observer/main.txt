see the folder in Pictures of observerdesign which has :

1 -> idea to work on next to improve the code -> smart pointers , enum class , changin ds from forward_list to std::priority_queue or other , changing ds of map to unordered_map ..... much more

// weak and shared ptr 
// ISubject be shared
// Iobejct be weak toward ISubject

// like 
/*

class B ;

class A{
public :
    std::weak_ptr<B> b;
};

class B{
public :
    std::shared_ptr<A> a;
};

*/

// here see A like the Observer class And B like the ISubject class
